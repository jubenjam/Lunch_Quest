ATTENTION CHEATERS/TESTERS:
    Pause the game and right click on the background for some handy testing tools.
    EraseLasers() will remove all lasers on screen
    CreateLasers() will add the lasers back, but may make stages harder/impossible if you 
        dont eraseLasers() first
    Skip() will jump you to the next level. If you use it on level 6 (the one without lasers)
        it will loop you back to level 1. 
        
    CreateGoal(), Reset(), and Win() are not meant to be used by testers.
    
    CreateDialogue() can be used to make Elmer say whatever you want, but that's not really helpful.
